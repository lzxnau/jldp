# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are neural networks with hidden states.

Recurrent
: Since the hidden state uses the same definition of the previous time step
  in the current time step, the computation of hidden states is recurrent.

Recurrent Neural Network
: Neural networks with hidden states based on recurrent computation are named
  recurrent neural networks.

Recurrent Layer
: Layers that perform the computation of hidden states in RNNs are called
  recurrent layers.
