# Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are neural networks with hidden states.

Hidden Layer
: Layers that are hidden from view on the path from input to output.

Hidden State
: A hidden layer output which captured and retained the sequence’s
  historical information up to their current time step, just like the
  short-term state or memory of the neural network’s current time step.

Recurrent
: Since the hidden state uses the same definition of the previous time step
  in the current time step, the computation of hidden states is recurrent.

Recurrent Layer
: Layers that perform the computation of hidden states in RNNs are called
  recurrent layers.

Recurrent Neural Network
: Neural networks with hidden states based on recurrent computation are named
  recurrent neural networks.
